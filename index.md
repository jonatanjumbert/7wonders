# About
7WStats! Will become your assistant to calculate the victory points of 7 Wonders, your favorite board game. Are you tired of wasting paper to score the scores of your 7 Wonders games? With 7WStats! You will save paper and have all your games perfectly organized without writing down the results on the score sheet.

The main features, apart from being a _victory point calculator_ for 7 wonders or even auto **calculate the score of the 7 wonders scientific symbols** are having all the manuals and instructions of the board game at hand, history of your games played, advanced statistics on civilizations with the most probability of victory and the most powerful tool of all: Guide and detail on how all the cards in the game work (all the 7 wonders expansions available - even Armada).

All 7Wonders expansions are available in the scoring assistant. It supports the expansion of **Leaders**, **Cities**, **Babel**, **Wonder Pack** and even the latest expansion of the game, **7 Wonders Armada**.

The cities expansion for 7 Wonders gives you the chance to discover another aspect of the great cities of Antiquity. 27 new cards offer you brand new buildings with never before-seen effects. 3 Guilds, 6 Leaders and 2 Wonders complete this expansion. 7 Wonders Cities allows up to 8 players at once and also offers a team variant.

7 wonders: leaders is an expansion for 7 Wonders that offers you the opportunity to put leaders at the head of your civilization. Represented by 36 new cards, these leaders will influence the growth of your city, each in their own way. The game play is slightly changed, but the victory conditions remain the same as those in the basic 7Wonders game.

Babel is made up of two expansions, which may be played together or separately. The first expansion, Tower of Babel, will allow you to erect the mythical tower. Each tile built will influence all of the players with regards to commerce, war, science, and civil affairs…
The second expansion, Great Projects of Babel, will allow you to enhance the area around Babel. Build its city wall, its port, or even its archives, and raise obelisks, triumphal arches, or other prestigious monuments to surround the Tower.
For your first few games, we suggest you play only with the Tower of Babel expansion, then only with the Great Projects of Babel expansion. Make sure that each player has played each expansion separately before combining them. You will then be able to combine these expansions with Leaders, Cities and/or the Wonder Pack.

Wonder Pack is also available in 7WStats! So you can record your games playing with the civilizations that this expansion includes: The Great Wall, Abu Simbel, Stonehenge or Manneken Pis.

Armada expansion allows you to build fleets of Ships to conquer the seas. New Armada and Island cards enrich the game and increase the interaction between players. The flow of the game is slightly changed, but the victory conditions remain identical to those of the base game of 7Wonders.
